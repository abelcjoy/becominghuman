        title: "Protocol: Alveolar Expansion",
        content: "Perform a double-inhale through the nose followed by a long, slow exhale. This pops open the air sacs in your lungs to rapidly offload CO2 and lower heart rate in < 30 seconds."

    {
        title: "Protocol: Photon Anchoring",
        content: "Viewing morning sunlight triggers a cortisol spike that sets a 16-hour biological timer for melatonin. Your sleep tonight is a mathematical result of the light you see now."
    },
    {
        title: "Protocol: Dopamine Baseline",
        content: "Artificial spikes from scrolling or nicotine cause an equal 'trough' below baseline. Your current lack of focus is not a personality flaw; it is a dopamine deficit state."
    },
    {
        title: "Protocol: Thermal Shock",
        content: "30 seconds of cold water exposure triggers a 250% increase in baseline dopamine that lasts for hours. This is a manual override for the prefrontal cortex."
    },
    {
        title: "Protocol: Neural Pruning",
        content: "Habits are physical structures in the brain. Every time a craving is denied, the associated synaptic pathway weakens (synaptic pruning). You are quite literally starving the addiction."
    },
    {
        title: "Protocol: Limbic Friction",
        content: "Procrastination is 'Limbic Friction'—the gap between Intent and Action. Override it with 10 seconds of intense physical movement to force the brain into a high-utility state."
    },
    {
        title: "Protocol: Insulin Blunting",
        content: "Consuming 1 tablespoon of vinegar or lemon juice before a high-carb intake blunts the glucose spike, preventing the subsequent brain fog and cognitive fatigue."
    },
    {
        title: "Protocol: Adenosine Clearance",
        content: "Delay caffeine for 90 minutes after waking. This allows adenosine receptors to clear naturally, preventing the afternoon crash caused by caffeine-blockage backlogs."

    {
        title: "Protocol: The 15-Minute Wave",
        content: "Neurological cravings are temporary chemical surges that peak at 10 minutes and subside by 15. Survival is a matter of managing the 900-second peak."
    },
    {
        title: "Protocol: Gray-Scale Habituation",
        content: "Removing color from your device reduces the 'variable reward' of digital interfaces, decreasing limbic attraction to the screen by approximately 40%."
    },
    {
        title: "Protocol: Cognitive Reframing",
        content: "A craving is not a command; it is a sensation. Label the craving as 'physiological data' rather than 'personal desire' to activate the medial prefrontal cortex."
    },
    {
        title: "Protocol: Reticular Activation",
        content: "Your brain filters reality based on focus. Write down your primary goal every morning to prime the Reticular Activating System (RAS) to spot opportunities you would otherwise ignore."
    },
    {
        title: "Protocol: Glutamate Balance",
        content: "Excess screen time increases glutamate, the brain's primary excitatory neurotransmitter. 5 minutes of total eye closure (NSDR) helps rebalance the glutamate/GABA ratio."
    },
    {
        title: "Protocol: Proprioceptive Anchor",
        content: "When mind-wandering becomes intrusive, focus intensely on the contact between your feet and the floor. This shifts neural load from the Default Mode Network to the Task Positive Network."
    },
    {
        title: "Protocol: Non-Sleep Deep Rest",
        content: "10 minutes of NSDR (Yoga Nidra) can recover neural energy comparable to 60 minutes of additional REM sleep by resetting the autonomic nervous system."
    },
    {
        title: "Protocol: Precommittment friction",
        content: "Place your device in another room 60 minutes before sleep. The 'activation energy' required to walk to the other room is a biological shield against late-night dopamine spikes."
    },
    {
        title: "Protocol: Protein Priming",
        content: "Consuming 30g of protein within 30 minutes of waking stabilizes the tyrosine-dopamine pathway, preventing the mid-day mood fluctuations that trigger substance cravings."
    },
    {
        title: "Protocol: Monotonic Focus",
        content: "Multitasking is 'Context Switching'—it costs 20% of your total daily cognitive energy in 'switch cost' alone. Do one thing at a time to preserve your neural battery."
    },
    {
        title: "Protocol: The 2-Minute Rule",
        content: "If a task takes < 120 seconds, do it immediately. This prevents 'Open Loops' in the brain which cause a constant background drain on working memory and anxiety levels."
