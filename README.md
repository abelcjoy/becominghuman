# Clarity For Humans - Life Projection Engine

## 🎯 Overview

**Clarity For Humans** is a philosophical tool that combines a **Death Calculator** with a **Time Machine** event horizon engine. It helps you visualize the finite nature of your relationships and time, forcing you to confront the reality of Actuarial Grief and make intentional decisions about how you spend your remaining conscious hours.

## 🚀 Quick Start

**IMPORTANT**: This application uses ES Modules and must be served from a web server.

### Option 1: Using the Batch File (Windows)
```bash
# Double-click start-server.bat
# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

### Option 2: Using Node.js
```bash
cd cfh
npx http-server -p 8000
```

## ✨ Features

### 1. **Death Calculator (The Foundation)**
- Calculates your remaining conscious time based on Date of Birth, Country Statistics, and Sleep Habits.
- Real-time countdown showing:
  - Years, Days, Hours remaining
  - Biological Capital (Attention Equity)
  - Daily Burn Rate

### 2. **The Time Machine (Projection Engine)**
An interactive "Event Horizon" that lets you slide into the future to see what remains.

#### **Core Mechanics**
- **Time Slider**: Physically slide forward to 2030, 2040, 2050...
- **Relationship Anchoring**: Add key people (Parents, Partner, Friends) and your visit frequency.
- **Actuarial Grief Calculation**: The engine calculates exactly how many visits you have left with them.
- **Visual Feedback**:
  - See loved ones age in real-time as you slide the year.
  - Watch the "Remaining Events" counter drop.
  - Cards turn red/grayscale when a person reaches their statistical limit.

#### **Why This Exists**
To move beyond "Gamification" (Fake jobs, fake stats) to **Reality Projection**. It answers the question: *"If I continue living as I am today, what will my world look like in 10 years?"*

### 3. **Crisis Mode - "Crave Override"**
A 15-minute guided breathing exercise featuring:
- Physiological sigh protocol
- Visual breathing circle animation
- Crisis containment timer

### 4. **Daily Reflections**
19 rotating neuroscience-based protocols for mental clarity and dopamine baseline restoration.

## 🧠 Philosophy

This tool is inspired by **Memento Mori** and **The Tail End** concept. By visualizing the finite nature of your conscious hours and relationships, you can:

- Prioritize what truly matters.
- Understand that "2 visits a year" means you might only have 10 visits left *total*.
- Make intentional decisions to increase frequency or quality of connection.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Terminal Aesthetics**: Monospace fonts, minimal colors, high contrast
- **The Event Horizon**: A dedicated visual space for projecting future reality
- **Premium Feel**: Glassmorphism, smooth slider interactions

## 📊 Metrics Tracked

- **Conscious Time Remaining**: The master clock.
- **Event Horizon**: Your future timeline.
- **Relationship "Credits"**: The quantifiable number of interactions remaining with loved ones.
